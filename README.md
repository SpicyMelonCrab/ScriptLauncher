ScriptLauncher runs scripts. That's it. It's really simple — but also powerful.

Use it to automate local tasks, simulate inputs, manage files, or send system commands from anywhere using Bitfocus Companion or a custom frontend.

## ✅ How to Use ScriptLauncher

1. **Download**: [Grab the latest release](https://github.com/josephdadams/scriptlauncher/releases)

2. **Run from Source** (for development):

```bash

```

3. **Configure**: Right-click the tray icon and open **Settings** to set your password and preferences.

## ⚡ API

ScriptLauncher exposes both **Socket.IO** and **REST APIs** for automation.

### Base URL

```
http://localhost:8810
```

### 🔌 Socket.IO API

Use `io.connect('http://localhost:8810')` to get started.

#### Common Events
- `command` — General-purpose command trigger. Send an object with:
  - `command`: The command name
  - `password`: Your password
  - Other properties depending on the command

**Example**:
```ts
socket.emit('command', {
  command: 'shutdown',
  password: 'admin22',
  time: 5,
})
```

#### Result Events
Each command will return a response via `${command}_result`, e.g.,:
```ts
socket.on('shutdown_result', (msg) => console.log(msg))
```

#### Supported Commands (Partial List)
- `runScript` — Run any local script/executable
- `shutdown`, `shutdown_cancel`, `reboot`, `lock`
